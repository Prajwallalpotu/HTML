            A generation refers to all of the people born and living at about the same time, regarded 
            collectively.[1] It can also be described as, "the average period, generally considered to be 
            about 20–⁠30 years, during which children are born and grow up, become adults, and begin to have 
            children."[2] In kinship terminology, it is a structural term designating the parent-child 
            relationship. It is known as biogenesis, reproduction, or procreation in the biological sciences.

            Generation is also often used synonymously with birth/age cohort in demographics, marketing,
            and social science; under this formulation it means "people within a delineated population who
            experience the same significant events within a given period of time."[3] Generations in this sense 
            of birth cohort, also known as "social generations", are widely used in popular culture, and have 
            been the basis for sociological analysis. Serious analysis of generations began in the nineteenth 
            century, emerging from an increasing awareness of the possibility of permanent social change and the 
            idea of youthful rebellion against the established social order. Some analysts believe that a generation 
            is one of the fundamental social categories in a society, while others view its importance as being overshadowed
            by other factors including class, gender, race, and education, among others.

            <p style="font-size: 17px;text-align: center;">
            The word generate comes from the Latin generate, meaning "to beget".[4] 
            The word generation as a group or cohort in social science signifies the 
            entire body of individuals born and living at about the same time, most 
            of whom are approximately the same age and have similar ideas, problems,
            and attitudes (e.g., Beat Generation and Lost Generation).[5]

            <p style="font-size: 17px;text-align: center;">
                A familial generation is a group of living beings constituting a single 
                step in the line of descent from an ancestor.[6] In developed nations the 
                average familial generation length is in the high 20s and has even reached 
                30 years in some nations.[7] Factors such as greater industrialisation and 
                demand for cheap labour, urbanisation, delayed first pregnancy and a greater 
                uncertainty in both employment income and relationship stability have all 
                contributed to the increase of the generation length from the late 18th century
                to the present. These changes can be attributed to social factors, such as GDP 
                and state policy, globalization, automation, and related individual-level variables,
                particularly a woman's educational attainment.[8] Conversely, in less-developed nations,
                generation length has changed little and remains in the low 20s.[7][9]

                An intergenerational rift in the nuclear family, between the parents and two or more of their 
                children,is one of several possible dynamics of a dysfunctional family. Coalitions in families
                are subsystems within families with more rigid boundaries and are thought to be a sign of family dysfunction.

                Social generations are cohorts of people born in the same date range and who share similar cultural experiences.[11] The idea of a social generation has a long history and can be found in ancient literature,[12] but did not gain currency in the sense that it is used today until the 19th century. Prior to that the concept "generation" had generally referred to family relationships and not broader social groupings. In 1863, French lexicographer Emile Littré had defined a generation as "all people coexisting in society at any given time."[13]: 19 

Several trends promoted a new idea of generations, as the 19th century wore on, of a society divided into different categories of people based on age. These trends were all related to the processes of modernisation, industrialisation, or westernisation, which had been changing the face of Europe since the mid-18th century. One was a change in mentality about time and social change. The increasing prevalence of enlightenment ideas encouraged the idea that society and life were changeable, and that civilization could progress. This encouraged the equation of youth with social renewal and change. Political rhetoric in the 19th century often focused on the renewing power of youth influenced by movements such as Young Italy, Young Germany, Sturm und Drang, the German Youth Movement, and other romantic movements. By the end of the 19th century, European intellectuals were disposed toward thinking of the world in generational terms—in terms of youth rebellion and emancipation.[13]

Two important contributing factors to the change in mentality were the change in the economic structure of society. Because of the rapid social and economic change, young men particularly were less beholden to their fathers and family authority than they had been. Greater social and economic mobility allowed them to flout their authority to a much greater extent than had traditionally been possible. Additionally, the skills and wisdom of fathers were often less valuable than they had been due to technological and social change.[13] During this time, the period between childhood and adulthood, usually spent at university or in military service, was also increased for many people entering white-collar jobs. This category of people was very influential in spreading the ideas of youthful renewal.[13]

Another important factor was the breakdown of traditional social and regional identifications. The spread of nationalism and many of the factors that created it (a national press, linguistic homogenisation, public education, suppression of local particularities) encouraged a broader sense of belonging beyond local affiliations. People thought of themselves increasingly as part of a society, and this encouraged identification with groups beyond the local.[13] Auguste Comte was the first philosopher to make a serious attempt to systematically study generations. In Cours de philosophie positive, Comte suggested that social change is determined by generational change and in particular conflict between successive generations.[14] As the members of a given generation age, their "instinct of social conservation" becomes stronger, which inevitably and necessarily brings them into conflict with the "normal attribute of youth"—innovation. Other important theorists of the 19th century were John Stuart Mill and Wilhelm Dilthey.
